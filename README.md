# Fresh-Basket
This is a web-based and database project. The main objective of this project is to bring the farmers and customers in a common platform.

This project, “FRESH BASKET” has four modules: Customer Module, Admin Module, Purchase Manager Module and Sales Manager Module.

This project is web-based and “FRESH BASKET” will help the customers to search the vegetables easily. There are number of vegetables in this website so this project helps the customers to order the vegetables sitting at one place. Each user of this system is assigned by a unique ID. Later, this ID will be used for their identification.

Administrator can view farmers, vegetables, customers and he can also view the purchases and payments made by the purchase manager to the farmers. Admin is responsible for creating the purchase manager or the sales manager.

The Purchase Manager can book the vegetables from the farmers and he can pay the amount to the farmers.

The Sales Manager can process the orders made by the customers and he can also view all the orders.
